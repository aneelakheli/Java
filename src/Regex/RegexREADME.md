# Regular Expression

A Java regular expression, or Java regex, is a sequence of characters that specifies a pattern which can be searched or manipulating strings/text. A regex defines a set of strings, usually united for a given purpose.
A regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern.
It is widely used to define the constraint on strings such as password and email validation.
Java does not have a built-in Regular Expression class, but we can import the java.util.regex package to work with regular expressions. The package includes the following classes:

- Pattern Class - Defines a pattern (to be used in a search).
- Matcher Class - Used to search for the pattern. An engine that performs match operations on a character sequence by interpreting a Pattern.
- PatternSyntaxException Class - Indicates syntax error in a regular expression pattern.
