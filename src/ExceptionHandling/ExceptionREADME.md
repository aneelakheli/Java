# Exception Handling

**_Exception_** is an abnormal condition.
An exception (or exceptional event) is a problem that arises during the execution of a program. When an Exception occurs the normal flow of the program is disrupted and the program/Application terminates abnormally, which is not recommended, therefore, these exceptions are to be handled.

## Advantage of Exception Handling

The core advantage of exception handling is to maintain the **normal flow** of the application. An exception normally disrupts the normal flow of the application; that is why we need to handle exceptions.

## Types of Java Exceptions

There are mainly two types of exceptions: **checked** and **unchecked**. An error is considered as the unchecked exception. However, according to Oracle, there are three types of exceptions namely:

1. **Checked Exception:**
   The classes that directly inherit the Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error are known as checked exceptions. For example, IOException, SQLException, etc. Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time.

2. **Unchecked Exception:**
   The classes that inherit the RuntimeException are known as unchecked exceptions. For example, ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, etc. Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time, but they are checked at runtime.

3. **Error:**
   Error is irrecoverable. Some example of errors are OutOfMemoryError, VirtualMachineError, AssertionError etc.

## Catching Exceptions

Syntax:
A method catches an exception using a combination of the **try** and **catch** keywords. A try/catch block is placed around the code that might generate an exception. Code within a try/catch block is referred to as protected code, and the syntax for using try/catch looks like the following âˆ’

```java
   try{
   //Protected code
   }catch(Exception e){
   //catch block
   }

```
