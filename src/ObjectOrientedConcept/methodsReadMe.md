## Defining Methods

Here is an example of a typical method declaration:

```
    public double addNumber(double numA, double numB){
        //do the add here
    }
```

More generally, method declarations have six components, in order:

1. Modifiers -- such as _public_, _private_, and others you will learn about later.
2. The return type -- the data type of the value returned by the method, or _void_ if the method does not return a value.
3. The method name -- the rules for field names apply to method names as well, but the convention is a little different.
4. The parameters list in parenthesis -- a comma-delimited list of input parameters, preceded by their data types, enclosed by parentheses, {}. if there are no parameters, you must use empty parentheses.
5. An exception list -- []().
6. The method body, enclosed between braces--the method's code, including the declaration of local variables. goes here.

## Overloading Methods

The java supports _overloading_ methods, and java can distinguish between methods with different _method_ signatures. This means that methods within a class can have the same name if they have different parameter list.
overloaded methods are differentiated by the number and the type of the arguments passed into the method.
we cannot declare more than one method with the same name and the same number and types of arguments, because the compiler cannot tell them apart.

### Providing Constructors for Your Classes

A class contains constructors that are invoked to create objects from the class blueprint. Constructor declarations look like method declarationsâ€”except that they use the name of the class and have no return type. For example, in an example [Bicycle](Bicycle.java) has one constructor:

```
    public Bicycle(int startCadence, int startSpeed, int startGear) {
        gear = startGear;
        cadence = startCadence;
        speed = startSpeed;
    }

```

To create a new _Bicycle_ object called _myBike_, a constructor is called by the new operator:

```
    Bicycle myBike = new Bicycle(30, 0, 8);
```

new Bicycle(30, 0, 8) creates space in memory for the object and initializes its fields.

**Note**: If another class cannot call a MyClass constructor, it cannot directly create MyClass objects.

# Passing parameters to a method and constructor

The declaration for a method or a constructor declares the number and the type of the arguments for that _method_ or _constructor_. For example, the following is a method that computes the monthly payments for a home loan, based on the amount of the loan, the interest rate, the length of the loan (the number of periods), and the future value of the loan:

```Java
    public double computePayment(double loanAmt, double rate, double futureValue,int numPeriods) {
        double interest = rate / 100.0;
        double partial1 = Math.pow((1 + interest),- numPeriods);
        double denominator = (1 - partial1) / interest;
        double answer = (-loanAmt / denominator)
                        - ((futureValue * partial1) / denominator);
        return answer;
    }
```

This method has four parameters: the loan amount, the interest rate, the future value and the number of periods. The first three are double-precision floating point numbers, and the fourth is an integer. The parameters are used in the method body and at runtime will take on the values of the arguments that are passed in.

---

Note: Parameters refers to the list of variables in a method declaration. Arguments are the actual values that are passed in when the method is invoked. When you invoke a method, the arguments used must match the declaration's parameters in type and order.

---

## Parameter Types

You can use any data type for a parameter of a method or a constructor. This includes primitive data types, such as doubles, floats, and integers, as you saw in the computePayment method, and reference data types, such as objects and arrays.

```java
    public Polygon polygonFrom(Point[] corners) {
    // method body goes here
}
```

## Arbitrary Number of Arguments

You can use a construct called _varargs_ to pass an arbitrary number of values to a method. You use varargs when you don't know how many of a particular type of argument will be passed to the method. It's a shortcut to creating an array manually (the previous method could have used varargs rather than an array).

To use **varargs**, you follow the type of the last parameter by an **ellipsis** (three dots, ...), then a space, and the parameter name. The method can then be called with any number of that parameter, including none

```java
public Polygon polygonFrom(Point... corners) {
    int numberOfSides = corners.length;
    double squareOfSide1, lengthOfSide1;
    squareOfSide1 = (corners[1].x - corners[0].x)
                     * (corners[1].x - corners[0].x)
                     + (corners[1].y - corners[0].y)
                     * (corners[1].y - corners[0].y);
    lengthOfSide1 = Math.sqrt(squareOfSide1);

    // more method body code follows that creates and returns a
    // polygon connecting the Points
}
```

You can see that, inside the method, corners is treated like an array. The method can be called either with an array or with a sequence of arguments. The code in the method body will treat the parameter as an array in either case.

You will most commonly see varargs with the printing methods; for example, this printf method:

```java
public PrintStream printf(String format, Object... args)
```

allows you to print an arbitrary number of objects. It can be called like this:

```java
System.out.printf("%s: %d, %s%n", name, idnum, address);

```

or like this

```java
System.out.printf("%s: %d, %s, %s, %s%n", name, idnum, address, phone, email);

```

or with yet a different number of arguments.

# Constructors in java

In Java, a **constructor** is a block of codes similar to the method. It is called when an instance of the class is created. At the time of calling constructor, memory for the object is allocated in the memory. It is a special type of method which is used to initialize the object. Every time an object is created using the _new()_ keyword, at least one constructor is called.

It calls a default constructor if there is no constructor available in the class. In such case, Java compiler provides a default constructor by default. There are two types of constructors in java: _no-arg_ constructor, and _parameterized_ constructor.

## Rules for creating java constructor:

There are two rules defined for the constructor:

1. Constructor name must be the same as its class name.
2. A Constructor must hava no explicit return type.
3. A java constructor cannot be _abstract_, _static_, _final_, and _synchronized_

## Constructor Overloading in Java

In java, a constructor is just like a method but without return type. It can also be overloaded
like method.

Constructor overloading in Java is a technique of having more than one constructor with different parameter lists. They are arranged in a way that each constructor performs a different task. They are differentiated by the compiler by the number of parameters in the list and their types.
