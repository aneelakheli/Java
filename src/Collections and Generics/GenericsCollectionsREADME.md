## Generics

Generics means _parameterized_ types. Parameterized types are important because they enables us to create classes, interfaces, and methods in which the type of data upon which they operate is specified as a parameters. using generics, it is possible to create a single class, for example, that automatically works with different types of data. A class, interface, or method that operates on a parameterized type is called _generics_ as in _generic class_ or _generic method_.
