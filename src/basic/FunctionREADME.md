# FUNCTION:

## Argument vs Parameter

**Argument**
An argument is a value passed to a function when the function is called. whenever any function is called during the execution of the program there are some values passed with function. These values are called arguments. An arguments when passed with a function replaces with those variables which were during the function definitition and the function is then executed with these values.

**Parameters**
A parameter is a variable used to define a particular value during a function definition. Whenever we define a function we introduce our compiler with some variables that are being used in the running of that function. These variables are often termed as Parameters. The parameters and arguments mostly have the same value but theoretically, are different from each other.
