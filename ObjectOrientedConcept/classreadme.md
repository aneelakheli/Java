```
   class classname{
       type instance-variable1;
       type instance-variable2;
       //...
       type instance-variableN;

       type methodName1(parameter-list){
           //body of method
       }
       type methodName2(parameter-list){
           //body of method
       }
       //..
       type methodNameN(parameter-list){
           //body of method
       }
   }
