## Java Naming Convention

Java naming convention is a rule to follow as we decide what to name our identifiers such as class, package, variable, constant, method, etc.

But, it is not **forced** to follow. So, it is known as convention not rule. These conventions are suggested by several Java communities such as Sun Microsystems and Netscape.

All the classes, interfaces, packages, methods and fields of Java programming language are given according to the Java naming convention. If we fail to follow these conventions, it may generate confusion or erroneous code.

## Adding naming conventions in java

By using standard java conventions, we make our code easier to read for ourself and other programmers. Readability of java program is very important. it indicates that less time is spent to figure out what code does.
The following table shows the popular conventions used for the different identifiers

| Identifiers Types |                   Naming Rule                    |                 Examples |
