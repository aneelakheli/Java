## Java Naming Convention

Java naming convention is a rule to follow as we decide what to name our identifiers such as class, package, variable, constant, method, etc.

But, it is not **forced** to follow. So, it is known as convention not rule. These conventions are suggested by several Java communities such as Sun Microsystems and Netscape.

All the classes, interfaces, packages, methods and fields of Java programming language are given according to the Java naming convention. If we fail to follow these conventions, it may generate confusion or erroneous code.
