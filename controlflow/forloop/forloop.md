# FOR Statements

The _for_ statements provides a compact a way to iterate over a range of values. Programmers often refer to it as the _"for loop"_ because of the way in which it repeatedly loops until a particular condition is satisfied. The general form of the _for_ statement can be expressed as follows:

```
    for(initialization;termination/condition;increment/decrement){
        statement(s)
    }
```

when using this version of the _for_ statements, keep in mind that:

- The _initialization_ expression initializes the loop; it's executed once, as the loop begins.
- When the _termination/condition_ expression evaluates to **False**, the loop terminates.
- The _increment/decrement_ expression is invoked after each iteration through the loop; it is perfectly acceptable for this expression to increment _or_ decrement a value.

The java _for_ loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times. IF the number of iteration is fixed, it is recommended to use for loop.
